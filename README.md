# helix-code-challenge
This project is a solution to [Helix Sleep Code Challenge](https://gist.github.com/tonning/1bd99ec5b8c60bb1a9d52577ac701313).

It was built with `Laravel`,`Vue.js` and `tailwind css`. 

### Why Laravel and Vue.js?
Vue makes the development of SPA's quite easy. 
- Being able to use vue in Laravel makes it easier for managing repositories; both frontend and backend can be created from one project.
- I think they have an easy learning curve, especially vue, which makes it easier for new people to easily understand the codebase.

### Why Tailwind?
I love using tailwindcss because 
- it can be customised with ease, and,
- it is relatively faster than having to write custom css.


## Project setup
1. Clone Project
2. Run ``` composer install``
3. Run the command:  ``` npm install && npm run watch```
